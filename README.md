# Tweets-classification-
Prediction of tweets topics (sports or politics)

In this project, I tried to follow two ways of solving this approaches to solve this classification problem. 

The first one is by using the tf-idf technique following by applying Multinomial Naive Bayes and SVM modles. 

The second one is by using the Word2Vec model to represent each word in a space of N dimension and then get the barrycenter of each tweet
by summing the vectors of word in each tweet and finally apply the Decision tree and KNN to classify these tweets in the space of N dimension
